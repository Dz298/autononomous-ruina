# Overview
This repo contains C scripts for the autonomous plane and boat projects while 
the microcontroller in both projects is **SAM E70 Xplained Evaluation Kit**.

Different modules include:
- SD Card data logging 
- Anemometer
- GPS
- IMU
- Satellite communication
- Wireless communication
- (tbc)

# Usage
Each folder represents a component module. Inside the folder, there're:
- a screenshot of the component's configuration with MPLAB X Harmony v3
- the header file of the module
- the source file of the module
- a main script showing how to call the module
- (tbc)
